                                    Emanta is designed to be privacy-focused. We do not collect any personal identifiable information (PII) from you.

                                    The only information you enter into Emanta is the data related to your GPA calculation, such as:

If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us. We will take steps to remove such information from our records.
